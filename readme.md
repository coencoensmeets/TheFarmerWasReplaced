## About The farmer was replaced
> Program and optimize a drone to automate a farm and watch it do the work for you. Collect resources to unlock better technology and become the most efficient farmer in the world. Improve your problem solving and coding skills. 

This game is a great way to learn the basics of programming and problem solving. It is a fun and interactive way to learn how to code. I wanted to check it out before gifting it to my little brother, so he learns how to code. I ended up playing it for hours. I decided to release some scripts to make the game a bit easier and more fun.
